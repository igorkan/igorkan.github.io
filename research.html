        My current research interests are:

            Complex Network Theory.<br />
            <ul class="desc">
              This is an interdisciplinary field which grew from the network
              structure analysis of different objects (social, informational,
              technological and biological), such as the Web, computer networks,
              information links in different media, personal contacts, business
              relationships, neural networks, metabolic networks, genetic
              regulatory networks and many others.<br />
            </ul>

            Self-Organizing Private Cloud Computing System.<br />
            <ul class="desc">
              It is obvious that most of the computer technologies are
              network-based. The main principles of such systems are developing
              right now. One of them is self-organization of the data
              distributed over a network in the style of private cloud.

              Adapting of the information technologies (IT) for specific needs
              of higher education is an interesting and complex task which
